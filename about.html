       <h1>Who is Ryan?</h1>
    <p>   I am a passionate fan of technology: how it enriches our lives, improves the human condition, and is boundless in its potential.
      <br><br><br>I am an analytical thinker, a learner through doing, and creative at heart.
      <br><br><br>I love tackling issues and problems; to me they are puzzles to be solved.
      <br><br><br>I also love creating things, the pride in a job well done, and the feeling of accomplishment in that this thing was made by my hands.
      <br><br><br>I have experience in Python, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
      <br><br><br>In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with computers, both hardware and software as well as time-lapse and street photography.
